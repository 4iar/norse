This document details how Norse is being developed and how decisions around Norse are made.

## Norse founding principles
Norse was co-founded by Christian Pehle and Jens E. Pedersen with the goal to accelerate endeavours within neuromorphic computing.
Norse is meant to be transparent to users and contributors alike and will remain free as a tribute to the open-source movement.

## Meritocracy
Norse is built on the principle of [meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), where participating members are advanced based on performance and skill.
Anyone can join the project and contribute, but the governance structure outlined below ensures that the founding principles are maintained while Norse continues to develop.

## Norse project management committee (PMC)
The project management committee (PMC) is put in place to develop, maintain, and promote Norse.
The PMC is empowered to take decisions when community consensus cannot be reached.

PMC members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage Norse copyrights.
Consensus should be sought at all times within the PMC, however, each PMC member has the power to veto any decision.

PMC members have equal access to the projectâ€™s private resources (such as hosting, billing, etc.).

### PMC Membership
Existing PMC members can nominate new members for the PMC.
A nomination will result in a discussion and then a vote by the existing PMC members.
Membership will only be issued upon unanimous agreement in the PMC.

Membership can be relinquished voluntarily at any time, but cannot be taken away by other PMC members.

Current PMC members (in alphabetical order):
* Pedersen, Jens Egholm
* Pehle, Christian Gernot

## Inspiration
The governance model has drawn inspiration from [oss-watch.ac.uk](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel) and [the Apache foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html).
