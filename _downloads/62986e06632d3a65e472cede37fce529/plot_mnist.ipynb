        "\n# Spiking Neural Networks\n\nSpiking neural networks are not that much different than Artificial Neural\nNetworks that are currently most commonly in use. The main difference is\nthat there is an insistence that communication between units in the network\nhappens through spikes - represented as binary one or zero - and that time\nis involved.\n\n## How to define a Network\n\nThe spiking neural network primitives in norse are designed to fit in\nas seamlessly as possible into a traditional deep learning pipeline.\n"
